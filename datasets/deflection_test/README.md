# Test Data

The dataset consists of X,Y,Z axis readings from the magnetometer for deflections of 1-20mm in the structure of: 

The sliced version of the dataset consists of only the y readings. This is the data we are interested in as the deflection is in the y direction. This is for compuational reduction in processing times and conciseness of analysis.
